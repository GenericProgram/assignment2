 * Function: create_spells
 * Description: Allocates a dynamic array of spells of the requested size and

 * Parameters:
 * 		size (int): Size of dynamic array of spells to create
 * Returns: Pointer that points to dynamically allocated array of spells

/*
 * Function: read_spell_data
 * Description: Reads all of the information associated with a single spell
 * 		structure from the given spellbooks text file and returns a created
 * 		spell structure containing that information.
 * Parameters:
 * 		file (std::ifstream&): A reference to an std::ifstream that is open on
 * 		the input spellbooks text file and prepared to read information about
 * 		the next spell in a spellbook.
 * Returns: The created spell structure containing the information of the
 * 		next spell in the input file
 *
 * Hint: “std::ifstream& file” is a reference to a filestream object. You will
 * need to create one, open it up to read from the spellbooks text file, read
 * the information up to (but not including) the first spell, and then pass it
 * into this function to start reading spell data. Remember that information in
 * an input file must generally be read by your program in the order that it’s
 * presented in the file.

 * Returns: Pointer that points to dynamically allocated array of spellbooks

 * Function: read_spellbook_data
 * Description: Reads all of the information associated with a single spellbook
 * 		structure from the given spellbooks text file and returns a created
 * 		spellbook structure containing that information. Note that the
 * 		avg_success_rate member variable of the returned spellbook structure is
 * 		not contained in the text file, but rather will need to be computed as
 * 		the average (mean) success rate of all spells in the spellbook (i.e.,
 * 		add up the success rates of all spells in the spellbook, then divide by
 * 		the number of spells in the spellbook).
 * Parameters:
 * 		file (std::ifstream&): A reference to an std::ifstream that is open on
 * 		the input spellbooks text file and prepared to read information about
 * 		the next spellbook.
 * Returns: The created spellbook structure containing the information of the
 * 		next spellbook in the file
 *
 * Hint: This function will need to call the read_spell_data() function several
 * times in order to read all of the data associated with all of the spells in
 * the given spellbook.

/*
 * Function: delete_spells
 * Description: Deletes a given dynamic array of spells and updates its pointer
 * 		to be nullptr.
 * Parameters:
 * 		spells (spell*&): A reference to the pointer that points to the dynamic
 * 			array of spells to be deleted.
 * Post-conditions: 1. Dynamic array of spells should be deleted. 2. spells
 * 		pointer parameter should be set to nullptr. Since this parameter is
 * 		passed by reference, the corresponding argument will be set to nullptr
 * 		as well.
 *
 * Hint: A dynamic array of spells is normally represented with a pointer of
 * type spell* pointing to the array’s base address, but here it’s spell*&.
 * That is, it’s a reference to a spell pointer. This is because the function
 * needs to be able to delete the array that the pointer points to AND modify
 * the pointer itself to be nullptr. In order to be able to modify the pointer
 * itself (which is an argument), the pointer needs to be passed by reference
 * (or passed by pointer---here we use a reference for simplicity).

/*
 * Function: delete_spellbooks
 * Description: Deletes all of the dynamic memory associated with the given
 * 		array of spellbooks, including the arrays of spells inside each
 * 		spellbook. The size parameter indicates the size of the array of
 * 		spellbooks.
 * Parameters:
 * 		spellbooks (spellbook*&): A reference to the pointer that points to the
 * 			dynamic array of spellbooks to be deleted
 * Post-conditions: 1. Dynamic arrays of spells within each spellbook should
 * 		be deleted (see hint). 2. Dynamic array of spellbooks should be deleted.
 * 		3. spellbooks pointer parameter should be set to nullptr. Since this
 * 		parameter is passed by reference, the corresponding argument will be set
 * 		to nullptr as well.
 *
 * Hint: This function should call the delete_spells() function several
 * times---once for each spellbook’s array of spells---and then proceed to
 * delete the array of spellbooks itself. spellbooks is passed by reference for
 * the same reason as in the delete_spells() function.
